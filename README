ASSUMPTIONS
I really don't understand what the function pointers in the struct do 
so I made some assumptions...

1) The compare function returns 0 (evaluated as false in the if statement)
2)The deleteDataFromList function works by checking each node, and if the data from that node matched the "to be deleted", it gets deleted. This is probably wrong :( 
3) I just give the print function data and it prints it... 

COMPILE
type make. 

SOURCE CODE
the linked list functions are in the src folder with the make file. 

okay goodnight. I'm going to bed now
